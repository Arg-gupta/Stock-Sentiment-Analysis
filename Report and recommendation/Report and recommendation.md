- **Tesla:** Mentions show a weak correlation with returns, while sentiment does not show a strong correlation with price movements.
- **Apple:** Mentions have a slightly negative correlation with stock price, while sentiment indicators are not strongly correlated.
- **GameStop:** Mentions show a strong positive correlation with both stock price and returns, suggesting strong price sensitivity to social media discussions.
